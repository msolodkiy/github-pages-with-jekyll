## Agile Product Management
# Product teams use minimum viable products and rapid experimentation to test hypotheses and validate ideas. n Frequent releases help fuel a continuous feedback cycle between customer and product. n Shipped and done are not the same thing. Instead of releasing a “finished” product, iterations continue to make incremental improvements to it based on customer and market feedback.
# Product teams are guided by high-level strategic goals and perhaps even themes below those goals. The product department’s success is measured against progress toward those strategic goals rather than by delivery of a predefined featureset
# Product constantly has its ear to the ground monitoring the market, customer feedback, and other factors which could influence product direction. When actionable insight is uncovered, plans are adjusted to better serve customer and business needs.
# Product strategy and tactical plans are reviewed, adjusted, and shared on a regular cadence to reflect changes and new findings. As such, product needs to manage the expectations of executive stakeholders appropriately and ensure they understand the “why” behind changes
